## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are the main plugins used by this workspace:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
